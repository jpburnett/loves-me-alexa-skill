Alexa Skill for a s/he loves me s/he loves me not game

The initial motivation for this skill was because my Dad wanted me to build it for him.

I am using the ASK-CLI interface, so when you want to simulate from the command line interface, run this command:

`ask simulate -l en-US -t "play loves me"`
